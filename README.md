# System-Wide Keystroke Logger (Educational)

## Overview
This project is a Python-based system-wide keystroke logging application created for
educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes. It demonstrates how keyboard input
events can be captured at the operating system level and stored with structured metadata.

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to help cybersecurity students understand:
- How keylogging techniques operate
- Why keyloggers are considered a serious security threat
- How such activities can be detected and prevented by defensive tools

## Features
- Captures keyboard press, hold, and release events
- Records keystrokes with timestamps
- Stores logs in both text and JSON formats
- Uses thread-safe mechanisms for event handling
- Automatically organizes logs in timestamped files

## Cybersecurity Relevance
Keyloggers are commonly used in spyware and credential theft attacks. By studying their
working in a controlled environment, security professionals can better design detection
and prevention mechanisms such as endpoint protection, behavior monitoring, and access control.

## Ethical Disclaimer
This project is intended strictly for **educational and authorized testing purposes**.
Unauthorized monitoring of user input is illegal and unethical. The author does not
encourage or support misuse of this software.
